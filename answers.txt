QUESTION SECTION

1. Should the server accept calls from everyone, or just a subset of users?
    :: In the project, the server will connect with pretty much any user who connects 
        with the server. In real life, it would be preferable to limit the set of users
        to a list of verifiable/authenticated machines.

2. Should authentication etc. be provided by the RPC framework, or by the 
    function that use the RPC framework?
    :: Ideally, authentication is provided by the RPC framework (machines that have 
        connected to the server can only communicate to the server i.e. try to prevent 
        message interception), as well as additional authentication for the functions 
        using the framework (login information, key exchange etc.)

3. What transport layer protocol should be used? what are the trade-offs?
    :: The RPC system should use TCP:
        - Pros:
            :: Maintains an on-going connection between machines
            :: Ensures that data is consistent and not lost, and is generally more
                reliable than other protocols
            :: Abstracts the scanning of individual packets so we can focus on a contiguous
                byte stream.
        - Cons:
            :: Relatively slow compared to other protocols, due to its reliability
            :: Will prevent a packet from being sent if a some data is lost, meaning
                connections with many lost packets will be greatly interupted.

4. In which function(s) should the socket(s) be created?
    :: The sockets should be created in the rpc_init_xxx() functions.

5. Should rpc_client and rpc_server be allocated dynamically or statically? 
    What are the implications for the client and server code?
    :: Dynamically - allocating memory in some static/global scope would mean state
        used for the server would be present on the client and vice versa (that's probably a 
        bad thing). Additionally, applications might have other functionality not related 
        to the RPC system, so we should properly encapsulate server/client state.

6. What happens if on host uses big-endian byte order and the other uses little 
    endian? How does that relate to "network byte order"?
    :: Different byte orders on different machines will mean the data will have to be
        adjusted in order to be processed properly. If we send data in network byte order,
        we can leave the process of converting network data to the machine and not the RPC 
        system.

PROTOCOL SECTION

Protocol Choice: [TCP]
    :: This protocol uses TCP for two main reasons:
         - It is designed to minimise packet loss and duplication
         - You can abstract individual packets of information into a byte stream
         - Single, continuous connection between server and client. 

    :: There are a few cons here though:
         - Speed of data transfer is slow, because of error checking and header information 
         - If data is lost somehow, it will prevent any other data from being sent through.
            This is perfect for a system that must be reliable, but for a system that just needs
            to be fast and doesn't care about the order of packets, this is unnecessary

    :: The protocol wouldn't use UDP for pretty much the opposite reasons:
         -  Data is not guaranteed to be complete when delivered
         -  Not connection based, so source of information is unknown
         -  Data is not sequenced in any particular order

    :: There are a few pros with using UDP:
         - Speed of data transfer is faster than TCP
         - Packets are sent regardless of packet loss
         - Allows machine to send a packet of data to many sources

Protocol Design:

:: Packets, Messages, Errors and Data

    All data transfered between the server and client consists of packets. Each packet 
    begins with a message describing a certain request/procedure, and ends with an "end" message.

    Messages are listed below accordingly.

    enum RPC_MESSAGE {
        RPC_MSG_CONNECT = 0xCC,
        RPC_MSG_FUNC_FIND = 0xFF,
        RPC_MSG_FUNC_CALL = 0xFC,
        RPC_MSG_DISCONNECT = 0xDC,
        RPC_MSG_END = 0xED,
        RPC_RTN_SUCCESS = 0x55,
        RPC_RTN_ERROR = 0xEE,
    };

    A message is simply a byte-integer with a meaning that both the client and server can agree upon.
    For the client, a packet can lead with any message, but must end with RPC_MSG_END. A packet that 
    begins with a certain message should contain a certain layout of data, which is specific to each 
    message. For some messages, this packet layout is fixed-length, for others this is variable-length.

    When sending a packet to a server, the client should recieve a packet back. The beginning of this
    packet will either be a RPC_RTN_SUCCESS or RPC_RTN_ERROR. A successful return will contain
    known data related to the initial message sent. An error return will always be followed by 
    another byte with error bit-flags, which the client can check to handle any errors. Again, each
    of these packets will end in RPC_MSG_END. Both ends can check the validity of the packets sent by 
    checking the last byte read is RPC_MSG_END.

    Error flags are listed below accordingly.

    enum RPC_ERROR {
        RPC_ERROR_NONE = 0x0,
        RPC_ERROR_CXN_INVALID = 0x1,
        RPC_ERROR_FUNC_NOT_FOUND = 0x2,
        RPC_ERROR_DATA_INT_OVF = 0x4,
        RPC_ERROR_DATA_BUFF_OVF = 0x8,
        RPC_ERROR_DATA_INVALID = 0x10,
        RPC_ERROR_HNDL_INVALID = 0x20,
        RPC_ERROR_MSG_INVALID = 0x40,
        RPC_ERROR_PQT_INVALID = 0x80,
    };

    If any packet contains information related to rpc_data, the data itself must be preceeded 
    with a byte containing data bit-flags that describe the stored data. The data itself must be 
    ordered in order of data1, then data2_len, and then the bytes in data2. The fields that 
    correspond to data1 and data2_len are both 64-bit fields (signed and unsigned respectively), while 
    the bytes corresponding to data2 is of the same length as data2_len.

    Data flags are listed below accordingly.

    enum RPC_DATA_FLAG {
        RPC_DATA_NONE = 0x0,
        RPC_DATA_INT = 0x1,
        RPC_DATA_BUFF = 0x80,
    };

:: RPC_MESSAGE Packets

    Packets are formatted such that they can be parsed linearly; most data elements in a packet are 
    fixed length. If a packet contains a variable length data element, this element will be preceeded 
    by a value indicating its length so it can be parsed in accordingly. Where size > 1 and is fixed, 
    the data will be in network byte order.

    [CLIENT -> SERVER]

     - RPC_MSG_CONNECT
        (Client is initialising a connection to a server)

        :: Packet Contents (4 bytes):
            { size: 1, value: RPC_MSG_CONNECT }
            { size: 1, value: sizeof(int)     } 
            { size: 1, value: sizeof(size_t)  } 
            { size: 1, value: RPC_MSG_END     }

        :: Return on Success (4 bytes):
            { size: 1, value: RPC_RTN_SUCCESS }
            { size: 1, value: sizeof(int)     } 
            { size: 1, value: sizeof(size_t)  } 
            { size: 1, value: RPC_MSG_END     }

        :: Possible error return flags:
            RPC_ERROR_PQT_INVALID

        :: Notes:
             - The client MUST send this message before attempting to use other messages, ideally this 
                is the first message sent to the server proceeding the connection to the server. Otherwise, 
                trying to send other messages will result in the server sending an RPC_ERROR_CXN_INVALID.

             - The client sends the size of their int and size_t in bytes, and receives the size of the 
                server's int and size_t in bytes. The client is expected to use these returned values to 
                calculate the int_max, int_min and size_max of the server, and use these values to ensure 
                any rpc_data sent to the server will not overflow on the server's machine. The server will 
                do the same for rpc_data sent to the client. 


     - RPC_MSG_FUNC_FIND
        (Client wants to find a function on the server)

        :: Packet Contents (variable):
            { size: 1, value: RPC_MSG_FUNC_FIND }
            { size: 2, value: len_name          }
            { size: len_name, buffer: func_name }
            { size: 1, value: RPC_MSG_END       }

        :: Return on Success (10 bytes):
            { size: 1, value: RPC_RTN_SUCCESS      }
            { size: 8, value: 64-bit int func hash }
            { size: 1, value: RPC_MSG_END          }

        :: Possible error return flags:
            RPC_ERROR_PQT_INVALID
            RPC_ERROR_CXN_INVALID
            RPC_ERROR_FUNC_NOT_FOUND

        :: Notes:
             - Name sent by the client is assumed to be an ASCII string. The client should NOT send the
                null terminating byte at the end of the string. Implies that len_name also does not include
                the null terminating byte.

             - The length of the name sent by the client must be less than MAX(uint16).
                This is because its fairly unreasonable to have a name length be larger than
                65535 bytes.


     - RPC_MSG_FUNC_CALL
        (Client wants to call a function on server with an rpc_data)

        :: Packet Contents (variable):
            { size: 1, value: RPC_MSG_FUNC_CALL }
            { size: 1, value: rpc_data_flags    }

            ----------[start of rpc_data]----------
            | #IF (data_flags & RPC_DATA_INT):    |
            | { size: 8, value: data1           } |
            | #END                                |
            | #IF (data_flags & RPC_DATA_BUFF):   |
            | { size: 8, value: data2_len       } |
            | { size: data2_len, buffer: data2  } |
            | #END                                |
            -----------[end of rpc_data]-----------

            { size: 8, value: 64-bit func hash  }
            { size: 1, value: RPC_MSG_END       }

        :: Return on Success (variable):
            { size: 1, value: RPC_RTN_SUCCESS   } 
            { size: 1, value: rpc_data_flags    }

            ----------[start of rpc_data]----------
            | #IF (data_flags & RPC_DATA_INT):    |
            | { size: 8, value: data1           } | 
            | #END                                |
            | #IF (data_flags & RPC_DATA_BUFF):   |
            | { size: 8, value: data2_len       } |
            | { size: data2_len, buffer: data2  } |
            | #END                                |
            -----------[end of rpc_data]-----------

            { size: 8, value: 64-bit int hash   }
            { size: 1, value: RPC_MSG_END       }

        :: Possible error return flags:
            RPC_ERROR_PQT_INVALID
            RPC_ERROR_CXN_INVALID
            RPC_ERROR_DATA_BUFF_OVF
            RPC_ERROR_DATA_INT_OVF
            RPC_ERROR_DATA_INVALID
            RPC_ERROR_HNDL_INVALID

        :: Notes:
             - Client and server should use data_flags to dynamically read in the fields
                of rpc_data. 
            
             - The order of rpc_data is always data1, then data2_len, and then a variable length
                buffer of bytes (given that these fields exist). 

             - Any rpc_data sent must be checked by the side sending the data using the data sent

    - RPC_MSG_DISCONNECT:
        (Client is disconnecting from server)

        :: Packet Contents (1 byte):
            { size: 1, value: RPC_MSG_DISCONNECT }

        :: Return on Success (0 byte):

        :: Note: 
            Client should close socket immediately after sending this message. Same for the server
            receiving this message.
    
    [SERVER -> CLIENT]

     - RPC_RTN_SUCCESS:
        (Different for client->server message. Look above)

     - RPC_RTN_ERROR:
        (Returned by a client->server message if an error has occured)

        :: Packet Contents (3 bytes):
            { size: 1, value: RPC_RTN_ERROR }
            { size: 1, value: rpc_error bit flags }
            { size: 1, value: RPC_MSG_END }

:: Typical Loop

    Here is an example of a normal interaction between server and client, using the message descriptions above,
    ( "L -> R" means L sends R data and R reads the data in ). The curly braces match the data elements that are
    described by each message above.

    1.
        client -> server: { RPC_MSG_CONNECT } { sizeof(int) } { sizeof(size_t) } { RPC_MSG_END }
        server -> client: { RPC_RTN_SUCCESS } { sizeof(int) } { sizeof(size_t) } { RPC_MSG_END }

    2.
        client -> server: { RPC_MSG_FUNC_FIND } { 4, ['a','d','d','2'] } { RPC_MSG_END }
        server -> client: { RPC_RTN_SUCCESS } { 0x1234567890ABCDEF } { RPC_MSG_END }

    3.
        client -> server: { RPC_MSG_FUNC_CALL } 
                          { RPC_DATA_INT | RPC_DATA_BUFF } 
                          { 1, 1, [01] } 
                          { 0x1234567890ABCDEF } 
                          { RPC_MSG_END }

        server -> client: { RPC_RTN_SUCCESS }
                          { RPC_DATA_INT } 
                          { 2 } 
                          { RPC_MSG_END }

    4.
        client -> server: { RPC_MSG_DISCONNECT }
 
    ERROR.
        server -> client: { RPC_RTN_ERROR } { RPC_ERROR_PQT_INVALID } { RPC_MSG_END }
